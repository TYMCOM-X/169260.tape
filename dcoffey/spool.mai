Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.
        Enabling SPOOL . . . Enabled.
         Can not continue !
        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old
        phone number.

Dave,

  I neglected to ask you for one piece of information necessary to make the
SPOOL system on B39 complete.  What nodes (i.e., TYMSATs/CONSATs) do you want
associated with each of these pritner sites?  

  SPOOL is designed to allow a default association of logged-in node number
with a remote printer site.  When this list is available to SPOOL, any user
logged in from a terminal connected to one of the nodes in the list can have
his job printed at the remote location by just specifying REMOTE.  No node
number need be specified when the user's choice matches the default for his
CONSAT.

  BUBBNET is small enough to make this practical, since we're talking about
only one or two remote sites.  Hell, you might want every BUBBNET CONSAT
associated with the active printer site.

                                                                Regards,
                                                                Dennis

Jan,

  Thanks for your timely reply to my query about the printers.  There is still
one moderately urgent printer location issue unresolved, so I need your
help.  We have an ultimate default printer location, for those nodes that do
not have a default printer site.  Tbis is (the non-existant) Building A.
Since there are very many nodes in the network that do not--and cannot--have a
default printer site, we must clean up the message--and the code--that refer
to the default-default printer site.

  If you want to discuss ideas and the scope of the problem, please call.

    Dennis

Dennis,   
     
Remove the following PRINTER LOCATION NUMBER from the Spool Database: 
     
 1   
 2   
 3   
 6   
78   
     
I will work with our affiliates to update their PRINTER LOCATION address.  
I do not know how soon I will get a report from them, so as I receive them 
I will forward the changes to you. 
     
Okay, Okay!

Dennis,

  Regarding the location of the new SPOOL site, the new location will be:

                  2580 North 1st. Street
                  Fifth Floor Building B
                  Backbone Lab
                  Dave Hopkins, Operator
                  922-6138

I hope that this is the info you needed. We have the fullcase printer
installed and running off of node 4166 and anticipate to have a
second printer installed soon. We are ready whenever you are.
 
                              Thanks 
                              Dave
